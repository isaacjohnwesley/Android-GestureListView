Purpose
=======

GestureListView is an experiment on how to achieve an effect like the one I described `here on StackOverflow <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9309245/how-to-implement-android-listview-opening-gesture>`_.

Those interactions/gestures (call them whatever you like) are simply amazing and one can see them more and more in iPhone and iPad apps such as Twitter or Clear.

My point is to gather ideas on this in order to achieve such a feature on an Android ListView.

So please gentlemen, let's help the community.

Contributions
=============

The main goal of this repository is to be highly collaborative but a lot of path may lead to the success of this enterprise.

For this reason, if you want to contribute to this repo and not only work on your own fork, please follow this simple rule: Code in a dedicated branch.

We'll all see later what's the best solution and put that one onto master.

Let's be awesome!
